# Gmail Signature

Within this very small project I designed, coded and implemented a signature for my Gmail Account.

In order to translate the CSS styling of the HTML signature into the final signature in Gmail (which is basically just a copy/paste after the coding is done) the styling is done inline in the HTML file. Additionally, to prevent bugs with the images, these files are uploaded to Google Drive. With the help of one of Google's developer API's, I created direct-download links for each of them which are embedded in the code.
